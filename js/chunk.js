Write a function that takes two arguments, `arr` and `length`, 
that splits an array into groups of the specified length and returns
 them as a two-dimensional array.
If the array length is not evenly divisible by the specified length, 
the remaining items should still be in their own 2nd dimensional 
array.

chunkIt(["potatoes","molasses","greg","wirt"], 2) 
// expected output: [["potatoes","molasses"],["greg","wirt"]]
chunkIt(["potatoes","molasses","greg","wirt","beatrice","adelaide","mrs. whispers"], 3) 
// expected output: [["potatoes","molasses","greg"],["wirt","beatrice","adelaide"],["mrs. whispers"]]
```

```js
function chunkIt(arr, length) {
  // We're burglars!
}
